# Sentiment-Analysis
Analyzing customer reviews for airplane services and trying to predict success of service provided. Currently this code is just trying to predict the labelled output for given review wether or not they are positive/negative or neutral.  Once the model is trained on the labelled reviews we can then vectorize our text and send unlabelled data for it to predict if it is a positive review, negative or neutral.

The project comes handy when we as business want to understand what is the customer feedabck but at granuality like for food, for amenities the airplane provides, and many such drill down we can decide on. We can than include cross functional team to work together for which feature has space for improvemen.

Currently this project is focused on training model to predict the reviews into three classes using pre-train model of NLTK called VADER which helps tag reviews in positive, negative, and neutral based on compound score calculated. 

Machine Learning models used are Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logisitc Regression for classification problem that we have.
